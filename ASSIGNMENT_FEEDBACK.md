HI Victoria!

Beautiful site an works very well. There are a few JS errors thrown, but that's outside the scope so I ignored them. They do make it hard to test on mobile using chrome's inspector - I always have "pause on exceptions" turned on - but I got around it.

As you will see below, you've ticked most boxes! 

I would like you to look at the contact form, and also see if you can break the CSS in smaller files.

But that is just for your own knowledge - you have clearly demonstrated you know what you are doing and have earned a Välgodkänt grade!  Well done!

CRITERIA FOR GRADING

GODKÄNT:
-------------------------------------

3 separate pages: ✅

A header with a page title on every page: ✅
What I wanted hhere was a unique h1 tag on eevery page - google's SEO rating algorith looks for one and only one h1 tag on each page. I didn't make this clear in the assignmeent, so its no problem

A navigational menu every page with links to the other pages: ✅

Contact form:
  Very impressive!
    Email: ✅
    Message: ✅
    Required: ✅
    Mail to: ❌
    The form should have an action that triggers my local email client to open, with the requiredd fiels aded to the email body. Th eonly thing missing here is the appropriate form action.

RWD:
    Desktop: ✅
    Mobile: ✅ ❌
    On "Projeckts" the first and thrd project break out of their parent containers underr around 1000px;

Current page indication in the menu: ✅

Responsive Image: ✅
Excelllent use of images

RWD:
  Media Query: ✅
  Flex/Grid: ✅

Separate CSS: ❌
  Every page is loaded the same css, which means every page is loading about 50% more than what it needs!
  A better approach is to create a general style sheet for common elements such as the header and naigation, then create a specific style sheet for each inividual pages for theh elements that are specifc to that page. As muc as I like Ms Fluffy and Mr Simba the style for those guys should not be, for example, in the contact page style sheet.
  Semantic: ✅

Semantic Element naming:

Code Style:
  HTML: ✅
  CSS: ✅
  Beautiful!

  File names should always be in lower case
